## Identicon

-- Lists

-- Maps

Each identicon should not be generated randomly...say what?  billy should generate the same if you put
in those characters...unique repeatable token

iex(1)> hash =:crypto.hash(:md5, "banana")
<<114, 179, 2, 191, 41, 122, 34, 138, 117, 115, 1, 35, 239, 239, 124, 65>>

iex(2)> Base.encode16(hash)
"72B302BF297A228A75730123EFEF7C41"

### Real Key to generating numbers

iex(3)> :binary.bin_to_list(hash)
[114, 179, 2, 191, 41, 122, 34, 138, 117, 115, 1, 35, 239, 239, 124, 65]

### Grid Coloring

if even we will color the square

## Struct

Map used to stored data in Elixir application
 - No instance of image that has methods attached to it
 - Does not exist in functional programming

 Send the numbers to another function which will help us pick out the colors

 ## functions

 - very important
